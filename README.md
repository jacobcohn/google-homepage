In this project, I am recreating the Google Homepage.
This is my first project and I am very excited.
My goal is to use what I learned up to this point and finish the project all by myself (no looking at others projects, I am allowed to use resources though).
Here we go...

I just finished the project, and it was a journey.
For the first 2-3 hours, I did not really know what I was doing at all and got extremely frustrated. 
I ran into roadblock after roadblock.
Then, I took a long break and restarted everything when I came back.
All of a sudden, everything clicked and I was in a "flow" state for about 2-3 hours going from start to finish.

I learned a lot from this project and can't wait to get deeper into The Odin Project.
